## Introduction

Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I am passionate about programming, technology, and making a difference through innovation.

## About Me

Hello! I'm **Hundaol Abera Fita**, a passionate programmer from Modjo, Ethiopia. I completed my elementary education at **Glorious Primary School**, where I was recognized for my exceptional performance in national exams. This achievement opened the door for me to attend **Oromia Development Association Boarding School**, where I learned to live independently and formed meaningful connections with my peers.

My journey into programming began with the **Addis Coder** program, where I discovered my potential as a developer. I still remember the excitement of writing my first line of code—`print("Hello, world!")`—which sparked my curiosity to learn more about algorithms and data structures. Along with a group of like-minded students, I co-founded **Addis Coder Spark**, aimed at inspiring and encouraging young students to explore coding and technology.

## My Projects

### Self-Farming and Harvesting Tractor
![Self-Farming Tractor](images/pexels-pixabay-257699.jpg)
The idea for this project originated from the challenges faced by Ethiopian farmers in farming and harvesting their products. Agriculture is the backbone of Ethiopia, with 85% of the population dependent on it. Many farmers struggle with outdated methods, making it difficult to increase their yield. To address this issue, I developed a self-farming and harvesting tractor aimed at modernizing farming practices.
