## Introduction

Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I am passionate about programming, technology, and making a difference through innovation.

## About Me

Hello! I'm **Hundaol Abera Fita**, a passionate programmer from Modjo, Ethiopia. I completed my elementary education at **Glorious Primary School**, where I was recognized for my exceptional performance in national exams. This achievement opened the door for me to attend **Oromia Development Association Boarding School**, where I learned to live independently and formed meaningful connections with my peers.

My journey into programming began with the **Addis Coder** program, where I discovered my potential as a developer. I still remember the excitement of writing my first line of code—`print("Hello, world!")`—which sparked my curiosity to learn more about algorithms and data structures. Along with a group of like-minded students, I co-founded **Addis Coder Spark**, aimed at inspiring and encouraging young students to explore coding and technology.

## My Projects

### Self-Farming and Harvesting Tractor
The idea for this project originated from the challenges faced by Ethiopian farmers in farming and harvesting their products. Agriculture is the backbone of Ethiopia, with 85% of the population dependent on it. Many farmers struggle with outdated methods, making it difficult to increase their yield. To address this issue, I developed a self-farming and harvesting tractor aimed at modernizing farming practices.
